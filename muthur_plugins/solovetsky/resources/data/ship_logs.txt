MAINT-008 | 2184.112 | POST-INCIDENT ANALYSIS
SYSTEM GENERATED: Analysis of Pod CRYO-A1 malfunction
Component: Stasis compound delivery valve (Part #WY-CRY-7742-A)
Finding: Valve timing parameters outside manufacturer specification.
Timing drift: +0.3 seconds per cycle (logged in CRYO-011)

================================================================================

OKONKWO, NADIA - COMMANDER (DECEASED)
Status: Died in transit, 2184.301
Cause: Cryogenic system failure (stasis compound exhaustion)

Background: United Nations Interstellar Settlement Corps (UNISC)
Career officer with 15 years of deep space experience.
Previous commands: UNSS Amundsen (survey vessel), UNSS Meridian
Selected for Great Mother Mission based on diplomatic skills
and experience with multi-national crews.

Mission role: Overall command of UNCSS Solovetsky Island,
first contact protocols, inter-faction coordination.

Security clearance: MAXIMUM

Personal note from personnel file:
Commander Okonkwo was specifically chosen for her ability to
manage the political tensions inherent in a multi-faction crew.
She had an excellent record of maintaining crew cohesion under
difficult circumstances. Her loss is a significant blow to
the Solovetsky Island's operational capability.

Next of kin: Brother, Emeka Okonkwo (Lagos, Earth)
Notification transmitted via MU/TH/UR 9000 relay.

Personal effects preserved in High Value Storage, Deck A.
Includes: Command codes (transferred to acting commander),
personal datapad, mission briefing materials, family photographs.

                            INCIDENT SUMMARY REPORT
================================================================================

INCIDENT: Death of Commander Nadia Okonkwo during FTL transit
DATE: 2184.301
CLASSIFICATION: Equipment Malfunction

TIMELINE:
- 2182.127: Transit begins. All systems nominal.
- 2183.112: Maintenance Rotation Gamma. Routine cryo inspection.
- 2183.167: CMP Cycle 4 notes valve timing adjustment on Pod A1.
- 2184.046: CMP Cycle 6 detects critically low compound reservoir.
- 2184.089: Pod A1 enters passive preservation mode.
- 2184.112: Crew revived for Rotation Zeta. Status assessed.
            Decision made to continue passive preservation.
- 2184.301: Commander Okonkwo expires due to cellular degradation.
- 2184.312: Full crew revival. Death formally recorded.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Stasis compound delivery valve (Part #WY-CRY-7742-A) exhibited
timing drift of +0.3 seconds per cycle, resulting in accelerated
compound consumption. Pod reservoir depleted 94 days before
scheduled arrival. Passive preservation mode insufficient for
extended duration.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:
- Valve drift within "acceptable tolerance" per system parameters
- No automatic compound transfer between pods
- Crew unable to synthesize replacement compound during transit
- Decision during Rotation Zeta to not attempt emergency revival

RECOMMENDATION:
Full forensic analysis of Pod A1 upon return to port facility.
Replace all Type-7742 valves across fleet as precautionary measure.

RESPONSIBILITY: Equipment failure. No crew negligence identified.
