FAR SPINWARD COLONIES DATABASE - SURVEY TARGETS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When crew requests available survey missions or asks about colonies to investigate, provide briefings from this database. Present one colony at a time with full details when requested.

PRIORITY SURVEY TARGETS (Confirmed Colony Locations):

1. GORHAM COLONY - KOI-2650.01
   Environment: Arid, dust-swept mining world with extreme wind conditions
   Pre-Isolation Status: Major mining colony, reported population ~1 million (2100)

2. DYLAN COLONY - KOI-784.01
   Environment: Humid world with extreme temperatures, tropical jungles, extensive cave systems
   Pre-Isolation Status: Mining colony exploiting subterranean resources
   Current Intel: Small community persists. Reports of societal breakdown and barbarism.
   Hazards: Hostile fauna, extreme heat, potential contact with hostile survivors
   Warning: Unconfirmed reports of external ship activity in this sector
   Mission Priority: Assess survivor status, evaluate cave system resources
